# Test code

This is test code, meant to be used with the python example to drive the bot with a joystick.
The idea that the STM32 code acts as "UART proxy" to the motor controllers on the mainboard.

Better use the [ros_usbnode code](../ros_usbnode) and use teleop to drive the bot, or ROS-Mobile on an android phone
